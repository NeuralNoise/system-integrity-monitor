1) Introduction
SIM is a system and services monitor for `SysVinit` systems. It is designed to
be intuitive and modular in nature, and to provide a clean and informative
status system. 

1.1) Features:
- Preconfigured monitoring of 25+ common services
- Preconfigured monitoring of 3 system facilities [load, disk space, network]
- Auto restart ability for downed services
- Checks against network sockets & process list to ensure services are online
- URL Aware monitoring for web based services
- Informative command line status display
- Event tracking and alert system with detailed log output
- Simple & Informative installation script
- Documented internal functions for expansion of modules

2) Setup
Fetch the latest version of sim3 from the sim home page at:
http://www.rfxnetworks.com/sim.php

Current snapshot always available from below link:
http://www.rfxnetworks.com/sim-current.tar.gz

Then simply extract the tar.gz archive as appropriate, ideally non-root user:

$ tar xvfz sim-current.tar.gz
$ ls
sim-3.0/
$ cd sim-3.0/

From this point once you have changed directory into the install package, the
'setup' or 'install.sh' script can be run. The different file names have no 
distinction, 'setup' is a symlink of 'install.sh' ('setup' remains in place for
sim -u compat from 2.5.x vers).

$ ./setup
-i      Install
-q      Quiet install
-u      Uninstall

In order to use any of the above options you will now be required to have root
access; su to root or similar to gain a root shell. Then execute an appropriate
option. 

# ./setup -i
Base path:              /usr/local/sim/
Configuration file:     /usr/local/sim/config/conf.sim
Configuration symlink:  /etc/conf.sim
Module control file:    /usr/local/sim/config/mods.control
Module control symlink: /etc/sim.mods
Executable:             /usr/local/sim/sim
Executable symlink:     /usr/local/sbin/sim

Once sim3 has installed you will then be prompted with summary of path 
locations; you should modify the conf.sim and mods.control (/etc/sim.mods)
files to your desired preferences.

Then execute the following command to add the sim3 cronjob:

# sim -j on

If you have or had a version previous to sim3 installed, you will be prompted
to remove it cronjob from /etc/crontab file before continuing. The new sim3
places cronjob within the /etc/cron.d/sim folder.

2.1) Usage
The usage of sim3 is very much like pervious versions and if you have not
used sim before then you will still find it quite straight forward.

The first task is to configure the sim3 main configuration file located at:
/usr/local/sim/config/conf.sim

You should edit your email address into appropriate alert option in conf.sim,
as well as configure any other options for advanced modules such as disk
space and load modules.

Then it is required to configure module usage directly in the file located at:
/usr/local/sim/config/mods.control
or
/etc/sim.mods (symlinked)

This file is very easy to modify, simply go through it and set On or Off the
respective modules you would like to use, obviously it would be a bad idea to
enable modules that do not apply to your current environment.

There-after executing the 'sim' command with no options will result in a 
default -help being printed to the screen; displaying all accepted options.

usage /usr/local/sbin/sim [OPTION]
-s, --status           Standard operation; display status to stdout
-q, --quiet            Standard operation; status supressed
-l, --log              Display log file [sim_log]
-j, --cron [on|off]    Toggle on or off cronjob
-c, --clear            Clear stat files; reset events

Using the 'sim -s' option will display a summary status of all services and any
related events, note that this is not a passive status output and check/restart
operations will be performed if a service is offline while running the '-s'
option. If you would like passive status you should use the -l option to view
the sim log file.

The other options, -j or --cron option is used to toggle on or off the sim cron
job, the -c or --clear option is used to reset all event counts, and the -q or
--quiet option is to run standard checks but with no status output printed to
the screen.

There is a sim3 maintained log file that tracks status of all modules and
internal sim3 operations, additionally there is a service init log that tracks
the output from all init commands executed; these logs are located at:
/usr/local/sim/logs/sim_log OR /var/log/sim_log
/usr/local/sim/logs/init_log

3) Extended Configuration
All sim3 modules are stored under a central path located at:
/usr/local/sim/modules/init
/usr/local/sim/modules/system

All advanced options such as socket and process check vars, urlaware checks
and any conditional checks are all contained within service modules. For
example if you run sshd on port 2828 you would need to edit the sshd.mod module
as so to prevent sim3 from restarting it in a loop. To do this you would open
the file /usr/local/sim/modules/init/sshd.mod and edit the socket_port var.

These modules are all function based with some simple standards in place to
ensure module sanity.

a - all modules must declare the module version in the first line of the module,
currently the only accepted string is as follows:
#sim_modv3x

b - all modules must declare a default state on the second line of the module,
currently the only accepted string is as follows:
#disable
Or
#enable

c - all modules must end with the file name .mod

So in recap all sim3 modules must contain as follows in the first 2 lines:
#sim_modv3x
#disable

There-after one may add the module to the module insertion control list:
/usr/local/sim/config/mods.control, in the format of:
# [sys/init].module [on/off]
init.newcheck on

3.1) Internal Functions
There is a number of functions that can be modified, examined or used as-is
to develop additional sim3 modules to meet any needs you should have.

These functions are not the most logical at this point and some have weird
logic to there variable names and input styles but nonetheless they serve there
purpose and are by far an improvement from the old sim2 which was much slower
and allot less refined in a modular capacity. 

In time we will further refine the sim3 functions, there naming and the usage
logic there-in. Should you wish to become familiar with any sim3 functions
you would be well advised to explore the following files:
/usr/local/sim/internals/functions.sim
/usr/local/sim/bin/sim
/usr/local/sim/internals/alert.msg
